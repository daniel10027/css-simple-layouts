# `04` Move the image behind the text

`z-index` is similar to the "Bring To Front" feature of MS PowerPoint:

![Z-index](../../.learn/assets/f4hm3qp.png?raw=true)

Elements with a bigger `z-index` are more up front than elements with lower `z-index`.

## 📝 Instructions:

Use the `z-index` rule to send the image to the back.

## 💻 Expected result:

![04-Move-image-behind-the-text](../../.learn/assets/z-index.png?raw=true)
