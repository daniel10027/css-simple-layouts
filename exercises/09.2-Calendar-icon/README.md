# `09.2` Calendar Icon

In this case, we are using the `::before` and `::after` elements to try to recreate a calendar icon like this one:

![Calendar Icon](../../.learn/assets/AlDLXvy.png?raw=true)

## üìù Instructions:

1. Please move the `::before` and `::after` elements of the `.calendar` element in the proper way, so they can be placed just like in the picture.

2. Please move the `::before` and `::after` of the `<em>` element in the proper way, so they can be placed just like in the picture.

3. Change their colors as well, so they can have the same color, and apply the `border-radius` to the `::before` and `::after` of the `<em>` to make them look like a ring in 2 dimensions seen from the front.

## üí° Hints: 

+ If you don't make them `position: absolute`, they will continue occupying the original area/space they were occupying.

+ This exercise doesn't have tests because the solution can be reached with different values, after your code's result looks similar to the example, you can go to the next exercise.
