# `02` Display None

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Hide the first `<h2>` element, but keep the space that it uses (use the visibility rule for that).

2. Now hide the second `<h2>` but this time use `display:none;` to also release the area/space that it was using (the bottom content should move up).

3. Display all `<li>` elements of `#myUL` inline.

4. Make `strong` elements display as block elements (that will turn them into boxes).

## 💻 Expected result:

![02-Display-none](../../.learn/assets/ccOZ42Q.png?raw=true)
