# `09` Beautify

This is a real life example sponsored by one of our students; in this case, he was trying to make his website look like this:

![beautify](../../.learn/assets/09-Beauty.png?raw=true)

Right now, some of the divs don't show, others show in a different way, etc. 

The problem here is some missing opening and closing tags, some CSS selectors are duplicated and some `div` have the same `#id`.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Fix the code and make it look how it was supposed to look.

## 💡 Hint:

+ The name of the next id's should follow the pattern (`div1`, `div2`, `div3`, `div4`, ..., `div6`)
