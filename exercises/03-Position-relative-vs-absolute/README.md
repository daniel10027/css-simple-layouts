# `03` Position Relative vs Absolute

This is very important:

1. Preview the exercise, you will see both `<div>` tags acting like default boxes.

2. Apply the class `.absolutePositionExample` to `#secondDiv` and compare results.

3. Remove that class, and now apply `.relativePositionExample` to the `#secondDiv` and compare results.

Ask yourself:

**What was the difference?**

The `relative` position is relative to the beginning position of the element, the `absolute` ignores the beginning position completely.

## ðŸ’¡ Hint:

+ This exercise doesn't have any tests, go to the next one after you finish with the instructions.
