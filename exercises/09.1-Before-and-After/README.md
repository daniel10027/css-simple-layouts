# `09.1` Before and After

Every HTML has `::before` and `::after` elements that are hidden by default. These elements are very useful when you want to create little details like badges, stickers, etc.

In this case, we are using the `::before` selector to create a triangle arrow on the left of the "Hello World" `<h1>`.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Use the `::after` selector to create another arrow on the other side of the `h1`. This new arrow needs to point to the right, of course.

## 💻 Expected result:
